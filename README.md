place to save some code that I may need to reuse on another machine

# FAQ

### what scripts can we find here?
note: script names are WIP

**randomizer.py** - generates random data that looks like typical cloud scheduling jobs 

**htshark.sh and kowalski.py** - scripts for processing Wireshark .pcapng files

**test.sh** - sandbox code

### Why don't you have a better way of sharing files across machines?
I don't own these machines and have limited privileges to setup file sharing

### Google Drive? Or even just email the files?
With git, at least I can version control the files more clearly. 

### Do you plan to actually reuse these scripts?
I can dream, can't I?

### This repo, like many of your repos, seems quite...
No more questions!
